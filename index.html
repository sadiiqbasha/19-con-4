            <h1>The Role Of
Simulation And Modern
Business Games</h1>
        <h4>Probabilistic or Stochastic Process</h4>
            <p>
            “Probability or stochastic process” is a name used to designate mathematical
models that represent the behavior of phenomena described by probability
theory, ranging from a simple game of coin tossing up to more complex
phenomenon like “Brownian motion theory”, “investment analysis”, etc.
Stochastic process uses mathematical models to represent phenomena ruled by
the probabilistic variation of some variable over time.<br>

            <p>
            Simulation methods, also known as Monte Carlo methods, are stochastic
processes that use mathematical models that have similar behavior of real
problems, feeding these models with random values generated according to
some probability distribution. The term Monte Carlo is used as a synonym for
simulation since in some problems the generation of probabilistic values was
historically linked to the use of the roulette wheel.<br>

            In this chapter we show how simulation method can be used to evaluate
complex decision problems involving uncertainty. This kind of problem involves knowledge of probability distribution (such as uniform, Poisson, or Normal
distribution) used to represent the probabilistic process and the value of
respective parameters (such as the average value and the standard deviation).

            Simulation is the most appropriate tool for visualizing, testing, and evaluating the
parameters and the dynamic behavior of a probabilistic process. Simulation
uses algorithms that generate a population of probabilistic events which makes
possible the estimation of the values of parameters of the problem. The results
of a simulation can be proven to be valid approximations of the values of the real
phenomenon which they simulate.

            <h2>Using Simulation to Compare
Multiple-Stage Strategic Decisions</h2>
        
            <p>
            In previous chapters, several aspects of decision problems, involving the choice
of the best alternative, uncertainties, multiple scenarios, multiple goals, etc.,
have been studied. However those were cases of decision for only one stage.
Many complex strategic-decision problems are formed by a dynamic sequence
of decision problems involving multiple stages of decisions. These problems are
more appropriately represented using a decision tree, and simulation is used
to make comparisons of different strategies along the decision tree.
Let us consider the following two-stage strategies:<br>
           </p>
        </div>
    <div class="hi3">
      
            <h4>Strategy A</h4>
    </div>
     <div class="hi2">
           <p>
            Stage one: Invest in a high-risk stock whose payoff (Payoff-A) can be
negative or positive values. Past data show that the payoff value varies from -
$100 (maximum loss) to +$100 (maximum profit);<br>
           </p>
        </div>
    <div class="hi2">
           <p>
            Stage two:<br>
a. if Payoff-A is a positive value less than $50, then the investor must pay $30
as expenses, or if Payoff-A is a positive value greater than $50, then the
investor must pay $50 as expenses;<br>
b. if Payoff-A is a negative value between $0 and (-$50), then the investor
must pay $20 as expenses, or if Payoff-A is a negative value less than (-
$50), then the investor pays $0 as expenses.<br>
           </p>
        </div>
     <div class="hi3">
      
            <h4>Strategy B</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="hi2">
           <p>
            Stage one: Invest in a high-risk stock whose payoff (Payoff-B) can be negative
or positive values. Past data show that the payoff value varies from -$120
(maximum loss) to +$120 (maximum profit);
<br>
           </p>
        </div>
    <div class="hi2">
           <p>
            Stage two:<br>
a. if Payoff-B is a positive value less than $60, then the investor must pay $30
as expenses, or if Payoff-B is a positive value greater than $60, then the
investor must pay $50 as expenses;<br>
b. if Payoff-B is a negative value between $0 and (-$60), then the investor
must pay $20 as expenses, or if Payoff-B is a negative value less than
(-$60), then the investor pays $0 as expenses.<br>
           </p>
        </div>
    <div class="hi2">
           <p>
            In this simple project, the selection of strategy A or B depends on the results
of the following events:<br>
           </p>
        </div>
    <div class="hi2">
           <p>
            a. “Payoff-A” and “Payoff-B”, with two possible results: positive or negative
values;<br>
b. “positive value of Payoff A or B” results in two possible values for
expenses;<br>
c. “negative value of Payoff A or B” also results in two possible expenses;
which provide 2 2 2 = 8 possible results.<br>

            <h2>Stochastic Analysis to Compare Two Similar Strategies
</h2>
        
            <p>
            “The analysis of a probabilistic decision problem to a broader band of variation
of the parameter values is made by a simulation study, using probability
distribution attributed to each value of the estimated parameter.
<br>
           </p>
        </div>
    <div class="hi2">
           <p>
            The estimated value of a parameter is used as the mean or average value of the
distribution. Asking an expert, it is possible to define an “upper limit” for this
average, such that only 5% of the possible values of this parameter surpass this
upper limit. In a similar fashion, it is possible to define a “lower limit” such that
only 5% of the possible values will be lower than this limit. In probability terms,
this procedure corresponds to defining a confidence interval for the average
value with 90% confidence.<br>
           </p>
        </div>
    <div class="hi2">
           <p>
            If the decision maker and the expert agree that the average value provided by
the estimate is located in a symmetric position with relation to these two limits,
the normal distribution can be used. If not, one can evaluate the possibility of
using other type of distributions such as the exponential, log-normal, beta,
gamma distribution, etc.<br>
           </p>
        </div>
     <div class="hi2">
           <p>
            In our case, we are assuming that the value of the Payoffs (negative or positive
values) has a normal distribution with the average equal to the value estimated
by the expert and the standard deviation equals to 25% of the difference
between this average and one of the limits found. In the case of normal
distribution an interval defined by the expression ± 4 (the average value
plus and minus four times the standard deviation) corresponds to approximately 90% of the possibilities of occurrence of the values of this distribution.<br>
